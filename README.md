### Project Description
MedHub is a web-based hospital resource management system that provides real-time visibility into critical resources like ICU beds, ventilators, and medicines. It enables administrators to update availability and allows patients to quickly check hospital status for better decision-making during emergencies.



### The Problem statement
Hospitals often lack a centralized, real-time system to share resource availability, causing delays, confusion, and difficulty for patients in finding timely care.



### The Solution
MedHub offers a simple platform where hospitals can update resource data instantly and patients can view availability in one place, improving transparency and reducing response time.

**Tool Used:** [e.g., GitHub Copilot, v0.dev, Cursor, ChatGPT, Claude]

**Purpose:** [What you used it for]
- Example: "Generated boilerplate React components"
- Example: "Debugging assistance for async functions"
- Example: "Code review and optimization suggestions"

**Key Prompts Used:**
- "Create a REST API endpoint for user authentication"
- "Debug this async function that's causing race conditions"
- "Optimize this database query for better performance"

**Percentage of AI-generated code:** [Approximately X%]

**Human Contributions:**
